just break up the Oreos and add them at the end of mixing. Otherwise, a good blender will do the trick and will break up the cookies for you. If your blender is hard-working, try adding half the milk to start, adding more as needed to make it blend. This will make a thicker shake.With a bit of cookie crunch, rich chocolate sauce, and creamy texture, it's no wonder that people are so fond of this flavorful Oreo milkshake. Serve with a colorful straw.
